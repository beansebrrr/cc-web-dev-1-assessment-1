# Web Programming 1: Assessment 1

This is a compilation of projects I have made for the Web Programming 1 assessment. This covers the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and allowed me to use them in tandem with one another.

## I. Recipe Site 

[Go to site](https://beansebrrr.github.io/cc-web-dev-1-assessment-1/01-introduction)

This is a simple mock website containing the recipe for Chicken Adobo ðŸ¤¤. THis made me use the most basic HTML Elements like lists, images, and paragraphs. I also used this as a chance to style the website with CSS. I added a navigation element that stays on screen even when scrolling, and a header bar.

## II. Links

[Go to site](https://beansebrrr.github.io/cc-web-dev-1-assessment-1/02-links)

This is a text-only website that contains information on the anime *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End*. It features its characters, the main synopsis of the story, and even gives us links to watch the anime. The navigation bar is the main star of this project. It lets us switch between pages and can bring us back to the home page too.

## III. Images

I like cats. These are images of cats taken from Unsplash (credits below each image). Above the images are buttons! You can press the buttons to apply a filter on the cats. There's blur, sepia, and mono! I mainly did this to test what I can do with JavaScript, and it's fun!

### Bonus: `<div>`

Below the cat images are divs that replicate the image of divs provided through the [Assessment Repository](https://github.com/lavanand/Assessment-1-WEB-DEV/blob/main/Chapter-3-Images/images.jpg). This pushed how much problem-solving I can do with just CSS.

## IV. Page Layout

[Go to site](https://beansebrrr.github.io/cc-web-dev-1-assessment-1/04-layout)

In this project, I made use of CSS grids to replicate an image provided by the [Assessment's Repository](https://github.com/lavanand/Assessment-1-WEB-DEV/blob/main/Chapter-4-Page%20Layout/Exercises/DigiFest.jpg). This practice helped me improve my skills in selecting the elements I want to style, which is actually quite important.

### Bonus: Study Planner

[Go to site](https://beansebrrr.github.io/cc-web-dev-1-assessment-1/04-study-planner)

This is a mockup layout for a study planner website. There's not much interactivity going on (but I mean, the checkboxes work), but I believe it would be quite a good layout. There's a pomodoro timer to track how long you've worked, there's a to-do list, and a notes area to organize the things you need to jot down.

## V. Embed

[Go to site](https://beansebrrr.github.io/cc-web-dev-1-assessment-1/05-embed)

Not much to say, this is a website with a video embedded in the center. The video comes from *My Deer Friend Nokotan*.

### Bonus: Alan Partridge Soundboard

[Go to site](https://beansebrrr.github.io/cc-web-dev-1-assessment-1/05-soundboard)

This is a fully-working soundboard where you can choose among a handful of audio to play, all separated into groups of 9, and can be navigated from page to page. If you're tired of that, there's also a text-to-speech area where you can input the text you want to be spoken, and hit the button below the textarea. This was a really fun challenge to dive more into JavaScript and its capabilities.

## VI. Petrol Calculator

[Go to site](https://beansebrrr.github.io/cc-web-dev-1-assessment-1/06-javascript)

This site can calculate how much it would cost to buy a specified number of liters of gas using JavaScript as the backbone. You can edit the cost of gas per liter, and then input how many liters you wish to buy. Upon submitting, text will pop up to show how much is needed.

### Bonus: ColorGuessr

[Go to site](https://beansebrrr.github.io/cc-web-dev-1-assessment-1/06-color-guesser)

This is a game! You're aware with RGB values, now take a guess at what colors would be produced if we mixed X amount of red, Y amount of green, and Z amount of blue. This is what ColorGuessr is about! You have 3 lives to get as high of a score as possible.
